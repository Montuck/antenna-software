    "1. Numerically simulate a Rayleigh multipath channel. Choose a transmitter location $(x_t, y_t)$, an array of locations $[x_r(t_m), y_r(t_m)]$ modeling a moving receiver, and random coordinates $(x_n, y_n)$ for Ns scatterers. The receiver should at least be a few wavelengths in total and a fraction of a wavelength in each time step. Model the electric field intensity at the receiver using $ E = \\sum_{n=1}^{N_s} R_n e^{âˆ’jkr_n} /r_n$, where $R_n$ is a reflection coefficient and $r_n$ is the total path distance from the transmitter to the nth scatterer and then to the receiver. For a simple channel model, $R_n = 1$, or the reflection coefficient can be uniformly distributed with magnitude between zero and one.\n",
